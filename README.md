# Just Another Text Editor - Progressive Web Application

## Description
This progressive web application is a text editor. I created this as a part of my bootcamp homework to further my understanding of PWD.
- PWD is a great way to make applications that work on all devices. I am really motivated to learn this subject to implement ideas on small devices. 
- I built this project to demonstrate, and understand how PWD works and think about buisness logic that it could be implemented with. 
- The big problem this type of application solves is to be able to create applications that don't need to be written for different OS. 
- I learnt about getting data, and putting data using web browser storage. 

## Installation
To get this project working in developer mode you will need the following tools:
- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js
- Web broswer (preferrably not internet explorer)

Once you have the above installed you will need to follow these steps:
1.  Open the intigrated terminal in VS Code
2.  Enter the command: npm install
3.  Enter the command npm run start:dev
4.  Open a browser window and put in the localhost:8080
5.  Click install in the top left hand side to down load this app or use in the browser window

## Usage
Once the app is running, this simple text editor will let you write code or just notes on your thoughts and feeling.
